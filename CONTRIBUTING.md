## Creating cropland maps
**Prerequisites**
- [ ] Ensure you have an @umd.edu account with Google Cloud access
- [ ] Create small map ~1000m^2 with an already deployed model crop-mask model
- [ ] Train a new machine learning model for Tanzania 2019 (or another evaluation set) and create Pull Request (PR) with [Ivan Zvonkov](https://github.com/ivanzvonkov) as a reviewer
- [ ] Once PR is approved, merge and confirm model is deployed to the Cloud
- [ ] Create a small map ~1000m^2 with your newly deployed model

Once prerequisites are satisfied, you are ready to create cropland maps using this system!
