## Sudan Agriculture

### In peacetime, impacts to agriculture include:
- Climate change and depletion of natural resources 
- Overdependence on rainfed production systems
- Poorly maintained irrigation and drainage systems and farmers limited skills in modern farming practices
- Limited access to agricultural inputs (e.g. seeds and fertilizer) and inadequate farming technologies and management

### Information on the conflict in Sudan <sup>[2]</sup>

- The recent outbreak of conflict began on April 15, 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces
- The conflict has exacerbated the challenges faced by the Sudanese agricultural sector.
- As a consequence of the conflict, food security has worsened and the population is facing a humanitarian crisis

### Stats following the outbreak of conflict (according to FAO 2023 Response Overview) <sup>[3]</sup>
- 24.7 million people, including 14 million children, in need of humanitarian assistance and protection
- 20.3 million people in high acute food insecurity
- 3.5 million children under 5 years of age acutely malnourished
- Nearly 5.8 million people have been displaced since the war erupted
- 4.6 million people internally displaced
- Nearly 1.2 million crossing into neighboring countries
- 60–80% of the population relies on agriculture as a main source of food and income

### Sudan crop calendar <sup>[4]</sup>

- Sudan has two cropping seasons including the main season from May to September and the second season from November to March when irrigation is typically used.
- Sudan’s main crops include cotton, millet, sorghum, peanut, and wheat.
- The main subsistence crops are sorghum (highest produced) and millet as well as wheat, corn, and barley.

### Farming Practices <sup>[5]</sup>
- The White and Blue Niles are important for irrigation as these areas produce the bulk of the country’s commercial crops.
Predominantly rainfed agriculture

### Crop Losses 2023 <sup>[3]</sup>
- Most reported difficulty from farmers was the higher than usual price of seeds and crop pests and diseases
- According to the FAO, in 2023 the main season had a total planted area of all crops estimated to be 15 percent lower than the annual average during the summer season
